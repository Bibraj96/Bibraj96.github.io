A career change isn't something that should be taken lightly. In my case, having just graduated with a BA in biology and began applying to physical therapy programs, one could argue that I hadn't even started a career. Yet, the decision to pursue software engineering was still a challenging one. How could I simply discard (at least) the last four years of education for a field that was entirely unfamiliar to me? However, software engineering wasn't as foreign as I had first believed. 

All my life I had been in the field of software engineering. That being said, I had been a part of this world primarily as a consumer. The media that has shaped the person I've become can be largely attributed to software development. From the vast worlds and emotionally heavy narratives in the video games I played, and continue to play, to the endless number of websites I've used for school or leisure. Software engineering has made my experiences as a consumer easier and more gratifying.

Ultimately, the desire to create something that one could seamlessly and joyfully interact with is what led to my career change. The opportunity to potentially make learning more accessible for students, or create a game that will last with the player was one that I simply couldn't pass up.
