Now that I've completed my fifth project assessment and graduated from Flatiron, the next few months will be spent trying to land a job. Just like the course, this takes quite a bit of preparation. Aside from the work I'll be doing with my career coach, there's a lot left to learn on the programming side of things. Particularly, data structures and algorithms.

Luckily, shortly after I graduated, Flatiron emailed students a github repo containing sources covering important concepts and practice questions strictly for learning data structures and algorithms. Along with youtube videos and Udemy courses, I plan on using this repo to learn all I can about possible interview questions and how best to tackle them.

To anyone still in the course, I certainly recommend introducing yourself to these topics as soon as possible. Even if you're still chipping away at the coursework, it would benefit you to at least be familiar with the basics of data structures and algorithms before you study them more in depth after graduating. Supplment your coursework with these studies and you'll thank yourself when preparing for job interviews!

Here are a few links to help get your feet wet (all beginner courses and videos):
